* can't change the name of a variable outside the function from inside a function 
    - this is mainly because the local scope is created and destroyed locally

* there is no block scope in python 
    - variables defined in an if/while/for loop is accessible in the global scope
    - only functions have local scope
    - for non_function block scoped variables, it is common to define the variable first before the if/while/for loop
